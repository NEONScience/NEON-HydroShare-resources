## Content of NEON Site Hydrology resources in HydroShare

`.json` file - NEON data product catalog queried from the NEON API for this site and subset to all data products that fit the NEON data theme of 'Ecohydrology'. This machine readable file can be read directly into the R and Python helper scripts (see next section) to explore the NEON hydrologic data products available at this site.

`.csv` file - For a quicker and more user-friendly view of the available hydrologic data products available for this site, the JSON file was parsed into a data frame and made available in this resource as a CSV. Users can peruse the available data products in tabular form.

## Access R & Python Helper Scripts to Explore NEON Hydrology Data Products

There are helper scripts coded in both R and Python that allow users to better interpret and explore the JSON file included in this resource. All a user needs is the ID for this HydroShare resource, and each script will read the JSON file directly into one's programming environment using HydroShare's hscleint. To access the helper scripts, visit the [NEON-HydroShare-resources](https://github.com/NEONScience/NEON-HydroShare-resources) GitHub respository. Users can clone the repository locally or download the invididual scripts to start exploring data products.
